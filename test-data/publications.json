    "title": "Closing the gap between traffic workload and channel occupancy models for 802.11 networks",
    "description": "The modeling of wireless network traffic is necessary to evaluate the possible gains of spectrum sharing and to support the design of new cognitive protocols that can use spectrum efficiently in network environments where diverse technologies coexist. In this paper we focus on IEEE 802.11 wireless local area networks and close the gap between two popular levels of modeling, macroscopic traffic workload modeling and microscopic channel occupancy modeling. We consider traffic streams generated by established traffic workload models and characterize the networking scenarios where a simple, semi-Markovian channel occupancy model accurately predicts the wireless channel usage. Our results demonstrate that the proposed channel occupancy model can capture the channel idle time distribution in most of the scenarios, while the Markovian assumption cannot be validated in all cases",

    "title": "Characterizing WLAN Channel Occupancy for Cognitive Networking",
    "description": "The deployment of heterogeneous wireless networks in the same spectrum space introduces the need for dynamic spectrum access so as to increase the utilization of the available wireless resources. Dynamic spectrum access needs to be controlled in order avoid interference between the users of different systems. Different schemes can be used in order to avoid the mutual interference between the systems: orthogonality in space, frequency or time. In this thesis we address the problem with a solution based on time orthogonality, in which the coexisting wirless systems are a WLAN and WSN",

    "title": "Impact of Asymmetric Transmission Power on Operator Competition in Shared Spectrum",
    "description": "To maintain affordable access for the rapidly increasing mobile traffic, base station deployment has to be tailored to hot-spot areas and primarily indoors where facility owners, e.g., shopping malls or hotels, mostly provide wireless service. Since such local access providers (LAPs) do not have access to exclusive spectrum, one proposed option is sharing spectrum with other nearby LAPs, e.g. unlicensed or secondary spectrum. Due to limited or no coordination between the LAPs, they selfishly access the spectrum, causing harmful interference to the neighboring networks. Especially by increasing transmission power, one operator may attempt to improve its own throughput at the expense of its neighbors. In this paper, we explore the impact of power asymmetry on competition between LAPs. We model the competition between two networks with different maximum power constraints as a network-wide power control game. By analyzing the pure Nash equilibria, we find that a lower power (LP) network becomes more aggressive to overcome the inter-network interference. Due to the aggressive behavior, sharing spectrum can out-perform fixed spectrum split even for the LP network, provided that the power asymmetry is below a certain limit. On the other hand, a higher power (HP) network is mainly affected by its own “self-interference” so that it has little incentive to employ complicated inter-operator interference management schemes. In addition, we demonstrate that the power asymmetry limit strongly depends on the inter-network propagation conditions, e.g., inter-building distance or building penetration loss",
